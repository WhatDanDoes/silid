identity-react
==============

`create-react-app`-bootstrapped application to administer agent identity within a dynamic organizational structure.


## Setup

```
cp .env.example .env
npm install
```

## Dev server

```
npm start
```

## Test

Start `silid-server` in another shell or process:

```
cd ../silid-server && PORT=3001 npm start
```

Since the API is running on port `3001`, the `identity-react` API port needs to be configured in `.env`:

```
REACT_APP_API_DOMAIN=localhost:3001
```

As above, the dev server needs to be running in another shell or process. From the `identity-react` directory:

```
npm start
```

Execute `cypress` tests:

```
npx cypress run
```

### Headless

Even if running `cypress` headlessly, you still need help from `X11`. Rather than tainting the host system with weird rendering dependencies, this is how you can use `docker`:

```
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e --network host cypress/included:3.3.1
```

Or, better yet:

```
npm run test:headless
```
